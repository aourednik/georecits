# GéoRécits: mapping journeys and lived spaces

Spatial mobility always involves at least two types of distances:

- the _topographical distance_ traveled on the surface of the Earth and
- the _time distance_ taken to do so.

GéoRécits allows you to map both in your web browser. It is written using HTML5, SVG and JavaScript. It uses the visualisation framework [D3js](https://github.com/d3/d3), version 5. Maps can be exported to SVG, editable in _Illustrator_ (CC and above) or _Inkscape_.

[Full documentation is available HERE](https://ourednik.info/georecits/)

## Online version

In the newest version, you can __drag and drop__ files to see _instantly rendered maps_. It also gives you advice on repairing misconfigured input data files. It is [available for online use HERE](https://ourednik.info/georecits/v02/).

You can also test the older 01 version online [HERE (lived spaces)](https://ourednik.info/georecits/v01_livedspaces/) and [HERE (journeys)](https://ourednik.info/georecits/v01_journeys/).

## Offline use

For offline use, all versions work best in _Firefox_ (>54) or _MS Edge_. (_Chrome_ and _Safari_ block FetchAPI in D3 from accessing local csv and json files).

## Examples

Example data are available in the _/data_ and _/exampledata_ folders.
