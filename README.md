# GéoRécits: mapping journeys and lived spaces

Spatial mobility always involves at least two types of distances:

- the _topographical distance_ traveled on the surface of the Earth geoid and
- the _time distance_ taken to do so.

GéoRécits allows you to do both in your web browser. It is written using HTML5, SVG and JavaScript. It uses the visualisation framework [D3js](https://github.com/d3/d3), version 5. Maps can be exported to SVG.

[Full documentation is available HERE](https://ourednik.info/georecits/)

Current version works best in Firefox.

Example data are available in folders _data_ (default), _data2_ and _data3_.
